Repository for first project files

April 5th 08:58
Latest and last updates are added to the files in the repository. To run it locally, will need :
work in progress frontpage.html, changes reflect the name change to index.html as required.
about.html,
recipes.html,
style.css,
Eliza_About_Page_image.jpg,
IMG_8335.jpg and 
IMG_8389. 
These files, all running from the same directory, should give a working site, at least they do on my home pc. Hopefully, Codeanywhere will get fixed so I can use versions to save a lot of time in future.
The others are kind of working files, different images, backups and general scribbles while trial and error was the order of the day.



So, the mission, apart from producing a first project, is to help a friend out and build a website for her fledgeling business as a wellness coach. Her name is Elizabeth Gillum and her contact details are on the front page. The copy is written by her, with the occasional minor edit by me. The photos were taken by both of us, mine aren't that great because I shot them in a gym in low light without flash so as not to disturb the other users of the gym. I was promised it would be empty but it wasn't. Life goes on.
The food photos were taken by her. I haven't tried the recipes yet.
Some code snippets I have discovered on the W3 website, and colour codes from the links supplied in the course. The links code in the contact section I took from the coffehouse pages, although they were altered in part to suit the user (Eliza). There may still be other snippets in the code from the same source, but it's all pretty generic. 


Basically everything goes on from the landing page, with links to the about and recipe pages. I'll be honest, I don't know what her main strength is, so the website could develop in different directions as time goes on, with either more foodie items or yoga pictures.
First page

As you can see there are links to the other two pages, the About page:

And the recipes page.

These files were originally developed with Notepad as Codeanywhere wasn't working and I had to get something down on paper, so to speak. I've since downloaded and am using Visual Studio for windows but the downside is that the versions are not recorded in Github, only the latest files as I upload them. This isn't a great solution but it's all I have at present. At least VS allows me to speed up the workflow.
Issues that aren't fixed.

Issues and possible improvements.
There seems to be an issue with one of the pages in that the formattinf styled by style.css isn't working. I haven't been able to figure out why yet. It did work, now it doesn't 
On the about and recipe pages there is an awful lot of white space at the bottom which I haven't been able to shrink as yet. Other than that it seems to work ok. It's not loaded with frilly bits, there are more recipes to add, as well as her yoga poses which I will shoot outdoors when weather improves. Some code snippets I have discovered on the W3 website, and colour codes from the links supplied in the course. The links code in the contact section I took from the coffehouse pages, although they were altered in part to suit the user (Eliza). There may still be other snippets in the code from the same source, but it's all pretty generic.
